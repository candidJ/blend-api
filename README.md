### Why did I make it ?
- As all of my work till date have been for corporates and private clients, I wanted to showcase and hone my dev skills. So I utilised my time during Covid19 to build a `Angular` SPA. 
- Since starting my journey as Web Developer, I didn't make any hobby/side projects. This is me covering up for a lost cause ;). I wanted to **blend** in all possible projects I would have made to begin with, into ONE application.

Most of my focus while developing have been to write *modular*, *resuable* and *robust* code. And I know there is always a room for improvement. Therefore, I would love your feedback and code reviews. :simple_smile:
