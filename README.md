# Blend API :v:

> I've created an Angular monorepo that seamlessly integrates the following web applications:

- Weather App
- Hacker News App
- Quotes App
- Calculator App

## Acknowledgments

The web application utilizes open-source APIs. I extend my _gratitude_ to the following contributors: :+1:

- [OpenWeather](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast) for Weather Forecast :cloud:.
- [Unofficial HackerNews API](https://api.hackerwebapp.com/) for Hacker News :newspaper:.
- [Quote Garden](https://quote-garden.onrender.com/api/v3/quotes/) for Life Quotes :pencil:.

### Motivation

- I created this side project during the COVID-19 pandemic to showcase and improve my web development and programming skills. It began as an 'Angular' Single Page Application (SPA) and later evolved into a monorepo, as most of my prior work had been for private clients.
- Since embarking on my journey as a web developer, I hadn't pursued any hobby or side projects. This endeavor is my way of making up for lost time, where I aim to consolidate all the potential projects I could have undertaken into a single application.

My primary focus during development has always been on crafting code that is **modular**, **reusable**, and **robust**. I recognize that there is always room for improvement, and I welcome your feedback and code reviews :simple_smile:

## Local Setup with Nx

1. Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) LTS version.
   - Open a terminal and type `node -v` to check if Node is installed.

2. Install [Angular CLI](https://angular.io/guide/setup-local) using `npm install -g @angular/cli`.

3. Download or clone this monorepo.

4. Navigate to the project root directory.

5. Run `nx install` to install all project dependencies and generate the Nx workspace configuration.

6. To start the app, run `nx serve` from the project root directory. The app will open at `http://localhost:4200/`. :simple_smile:
