# Blend API :v:

> An Angular Web App that shows Weather Forecast, Hacker News, Life and Programming Quotes.

## Credits

The web application consumes open source API's. **_A big thanks to following contributors_** :+1:

- [OpenWeather](https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/forecast) for Weather Forecast :cloud:.
- [Unofficial HackerNews API](https://node-hnapi.herokuapp.com/) for Hacker News :newspaper:.
- [Quote Garden](https://quote-garden.onrender.com/api/v3/quotes/) for Life Quotes :pencil:.

### Why did I make it ?

- As all of my work till date have been for corporates and private clients, I wanted to showcase and hone my dev skills. So I utilised my time during Covid19 to build a `Angular` SPA.
- Since starting my journey as Web Developer, I didn't make any hobby/side projects. This is me covering up for a lost cause:wink:. I wanted to **blend** in all possible projects I would have made to begin with, into ONE application.

Most of my focus while developing have been to write _modular_, _resuable_ and _robust_ code. And I know there is always a room for improvement. Therefore, I would love your feedback and code reviews.:simple_smile:
